        <p>
            <strong>Hi there. </strong>Hello. I’m Greg Bremble, a web developer based in Raleigh, North Carolina.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m passionate about coding, and fascinated by Space. If you don’t find me in
            front of a computer, chances are you’ll find me working on my car.
